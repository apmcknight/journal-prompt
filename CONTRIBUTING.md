# Contributing Guidelines
:wave:

Hi! Thanks so much for wanting to contribute to Journal Prompt!
There’s many way’s you can contribute, but there are a few rules to keep in mind. They’re listed below….

When contributing to Journal Prompt, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, on our Slack workspace [here](https://join.slack.com/t/journalprompt/shared_invite/enQtOTQ2NDc4NTI2MzU4LThlZjA4OTc5NmJjMzdjNzUwNzFlMWJhODM2ZjU2OGViNmIxNjA0Y2MxNGJmZWE2NjM1NTVmNzZhMDk4Y2FhM2Y), or by other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

We have a code of conduct, so please be sure to follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## How to make a PR
1. Be sure you create a new branch with the naming convention: “contribution-firstname-lastname”
	* **A note about the Master / Production Branch:** Used for production releases to the public facing application only; Is write protected, even from the projects Admin. NO ONE can directly write to this branch.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
3. Add a commit message with changes to the project. We use emojis to denote change types… 

:ant: Bugs <br/>
:star: Features <br/>
:v: Components <br/>
:speech_balloon: Documentation <br/>

4. You may merge the Pull Request once you feel your changes are ready. Merging a PR does not mean it will be merged into the production (master) branch! Your PR may be rejected, if it is, details on the rejection will be commented therein. You may re-merge the PR after you’ve fixed or improved upon the reasoning of why it was rejected.

**In Progress** CI / CD and tests are being built to ensure the master branch is not compromised. Although tests should be run on your local machine; this will be another save guard to prevent application failure.
