# Journal Prompt API
The Journal Prompt API (a.k.a, the JPI) serves "prompt" data to the main application. 

Currently the JPI is a non-dynamic JSON file, it's hard coded and only serving the "base prompts".
Soon, the JPI will be a dynamic REST API that can be contributed to, and even extended to other projects!

# Contributing to the API
Contributions to the API are currently not being accepted. However, the will be soon! 
* If you want to work to maintain the API itself, please let me know in our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/journalprompt/shared_invite/enQtOTQ2NDc4NTI2MzU4LThlZjA4OTc5NmJjMzdjNzUwNzFlMWJhODM2ZjU2OGViNmIxNjA0Y2MxNGJmZWE2NjM1NTVmNzZhMDk4Y2FhM2Y)

# Contributing Prompts to the API
We are accepting new prompts to be 'base' prompts that will be hard coded into the JSON file. If you have a prompt that you'd like us to consider; Please open a new Issue and flag it with "base-prompt".

# How to Extend the API
Currently the API is only extendable to the Journal Prompt application directory, and thus to only this project. 
I have plans to host a more dynamic API that can be called and extended to any project!
